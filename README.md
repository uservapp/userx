UserX Core integration/staging repository
=================================================

UserX (USERX) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware. UserX utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment.
